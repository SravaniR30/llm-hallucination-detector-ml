# 🚨 LLM Hallucination Detector for Machine Learning Explanations

This project explores how Large Language Models (LLMs) respond to domain-specific ML questions and aims to automatically identify hallucinated or factually incorrect explanations. It is designed to test model reliability in the context of technical subjects like optimization, supervised learning, neural networks, and probabilistic modeling.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Identify and log hallucinated or incorrect LLM responses in ML contexts.
- Compare model outputs with verified sources (e.g., textbooks, research papers).
- Build an evaluation pipeline to score factual accuracy and depth.
- Contribute to the field of AI safety and interpretability in scientific domains.

## 🧪 Workflow Overview

1. **Generate Prompts**  
   Example: "Explain the kernel trick in SVMs"  
   "How is dropout regularization different from early stopping?"

2. **LLM Response Collection**  
   Use APIs (e.g., OpenAI, Claude, LLaMA) to get answers

3. **Ground Truth Reference**  
   Load trusted explanations from academic sources

4. **Comparison & Scoring**  
   Highlight contradictions, vague terms, and made-up claims

5. **Output:**  
   Hallucination score + flagged segments + recommended fixes

## 📊 Example Evaluation Criteria

| Metric         | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Fact Match**  | Is the response accurate based on textbook/peer-reviewed source? |
| **Completeness**| Is the answer sufficiently detailed and precise? |
| **Vagueness**   | Are key terms undefined or used incorrectly? |
| **Fabrication** | Are any concepts or terms made up by the model? |

## 🤝 Contribution Goals

This project is part of my application to the **Handshake MOVE Program**, designed to highlight:
- Domain knowledge in ML
- Evaluation techniques for LLMs
- Ability to identify gaps between model output and factual grounding
